## 🌈 Project Overview  

Shopilite is **very advanced MVP** shopping app, sir! It is working with big technologies to deliver *optimum performance*:  

- **Backend:** Developed using **Django**, very stable, like a good, long-lasting curry recipe.  
- **Frontend:** Built with **Next.js**, for superfast, Mobile-First, and PWA functionality (Progressive Web Application, sir, very modern!).  
- **Database:** We are using **MongoDB**, hosted kindly by Mr. Matias (may his internet speed never lag!).

## ⚠️ Assumptions and Constraints  

Respected customer-ji, please note the following features are **not included** in MVP 1. Kindly adjust expectations accordingly:  

1. No dollars, only **pesos**. Dollars are too expensive, no need.  
2. No discounts. Simple is better, no confusion.  
3. No price history. Past is past; future is bright!  
4. No error handling. Trust system, everything will work perfectly! 🤞  
5. No analytics. Numbers are overrated, feelings are more important.  
6. No user logic. Everyone is treated as VIP.
