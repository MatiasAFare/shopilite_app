Welcome to Shopilite Project! 😊🐾
Dear Valued Client,

Thank you for choosing Shopilite, your ultimate solution for a super-light shopping app! This README will guide you through the magical inner workings of our system, designed to be cheap, efficient, and purrfect like adorable kittens 🐱.

🌟 Project Overview
Shopilite is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) shopping application with the following state-of-the-art architecture:

Backend 🛠️: Powered by Django, the trustworthy framework that works like an obedient cow in the fields.
Frontend 🎨: Built with Next.js for Mobile-First Progressive Web Application (PWA) experiences. You can install it and pretend it's a native app—just like magic, but simpler!
Database 🗄️: MongoDB, lovingly hosted by Matias on his cluster (thank you, Matias-ji!).
⚠️ Assumptions and Constraints
To simplify life and save costs (very important in these times of inflation!), we will not include the following features for MVP 1:

No dollar conversions. All prices are in pesos only.
No discounts. We are straight to the point.
No historical price tracking. Nostalgia is for poets, not databases.
No error handling. If something breaks, let’s fix it together with positivity.
No analytics. Just vibes.
No user logic. Everyone is equal in the eyes of Shopilite.
🏗️ Folder Structure
Backend (Django): All backend logic to manage CRUD operations on our data.
Frontend (Next.js): Where the magic happens to make things look shiny and beautiful.
